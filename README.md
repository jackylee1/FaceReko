# FaceReko
School IoT project. Simple Raspberry Pi face recognition security system for something like a door.
This project leverages Amazon's Rekognition service and was created for a Raspberry Pi with default account pi (adjust *install.sh* if different), a local mysql database and runs a simple WebApp.

The WebApp supports a login system with accounts in a MySQL DB. The FaceReko system can be turned ON or OFF from the WebApp along with viewing of access history with images.

FaceReko is currently built with being a door security system in mind. Tapping of an RFID card triggers facial recognition with a buzzer giving audio cues and LEDs representing access allowed or denied.

When activated, the system beeps when a card is tapped. If the card is recognised, the camera will begin facial recognition with AWS Rekognition. If the person is recognised, a long beep is presented and the LEDs turns from Red to Green for 10 seconds, signifying access. Else the buzzer will sound 3 times if the person is not recognised and the red LED remains lit.

## Hardware requirements:
Check frizting diagram/ image in repo for how to connect up the hardware.

- Raspberry Pi (Duh)
- PiCamera
- MFRC522 RFID reader and RFID card
- Red & Green LED diodes
- Buzzer

## Things to note: 
1. Default Pi account is used in *install.sh*, change accordingly if needed.
2. RFID card ID is hardcoded in *rfid.py* under variable `hid`, change accordingly. *check_card.py* can be used to find your card ID.
3. MySQL login info in the codes has been hardcoded to my throwaway db, change/ setup accordingly.
4. There is a `collection` variable in *FaceReko.py* which needs to be changed to whatever collection name you set to later in install.

## Pre-requisite setups:
  
###  Amazon Web Service(AWS) Rekognition
  1) Create AWS account (Free Tier allows 5k API calls per month)
  2) Login and create a new IAM user with "AmazonRekognitionFullAccess" and "AdministratorAccess" permissions (Refer to AWS doc for help: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/setting-up.html)
  3) Go to Security Credentials tab in IAM users page, generate and note down your aws_access_key_secret and aws_access_key_id

###  Local MySQL DB
  1) Install it, create accounts etc...(If needed) Import given sql file or follow steps 2 - 4 to create database and tables.
  2) Create a database called "FaceReko" 
  3) Create table "AccessLog" with the following columns and data types(Column Name, Data Type): 
		```
		(ID, int(5), AutoIncrement)
		(Name, varchar(50))
		(Time, datetime)
		(Similarity, decimal(10,2))
		(Confidence, decimal(10,2))
		(Image, varchar(30))
		```
  4) Create table "Login" with the following columns and data types (Column Name, Data Type): 
		```
		(Username, varchar(30))
		(Password, varchar(30))
		```
  
##  Install:
You can simply just copy *install.sh* to */home/pi/* and `sudo chmod +x install.sh` then run it with `sudo ./install.sh` to install all  pre-requisite packages, configure AWS and setup FaceReko files.
    
Mid-run of *install.sh* you will be prompted for AWS config info (This is where your AWS credentials you noted down earlier come in). For the first 2 prompts **enter your AWS Key ID then Access Key**. The 3rd option will be for an **AWS server region which supports the Rekognition service** (eg. "ap-northeast-1" which is tokyo). A full list of which servers support the service and their shorthands can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html (ctrl-F "Rekognition"). 

For the last option **just hit enter and leave default**.

Once complete, there should be a folder named *FaceReko* in */home/pi/* and permissions for it setup. (If there are any permission issues with the program later on just manually `sudo` run the last couple `chmod & chown` commands in *install.sh*).

From here `cd` into the FaceReko folder.

### AWS Rekognition setup
Run `python add_collection.py -n 'home'` (Replace 'home' with whatever you want to call your collection, remember to change the `collection` variable accordingly in *FaceReko.py*)

Run `python take_selfie.py` to take a photo of you or the person you want recognised. It will be saved in the same folder as *selfie.jpg*.

Run `python add_image.py -i 'selfie.jpg' -c 'home' -l 'Name'` (Replace 'home' with your collection name from earlier and 'Name' with the name of the person in *selfie.jpg*.

### Edit variables
In *FaceReko.py* and *server.py* change MySQL connection info if needed.

Run `python check_card.py` and tap your card on the reader to find out your card's UID. Edit *rfid.py*, look for the hid variable and change the numbers to your card's UID.

Lastly for this section, edit *FaceReko.py* and look for the `collection` variable. Change this to whatever you named your collection earlier.

## Usage:
Simply `cd` into the FaceReko folder and run `python server.py`

The webapp will be running on port 5000 (raspberryPi_IP:5000)

Once you enter the address into your browser URL bar, you will be presented with the login screen. Hit the Create Account button and create an account, regex is in place so only alpha numeric upto 30 characters are allowed. Once done proceed to login.

After login you are presented with the home screen. The access log chart displays up to the last 10 people who were recognised by the facial recognition system. The chart shows name of the person recognised, time they gained access as well as similarity and confidence of that recognition and lastly there is the option to view the taken image of the person during that facial recognition request.

Below the chart is the control panel which displays the current status of the security system (Active or Offline) and controls to activate or deactivate the security system.

So to use the security system, simply activate it, scan your RFID card (buzzer beeps on card scan), face the camera. If recognised as an authorized person you will hear a long beep and the LEDs will change from red to green. Otherwise you will hear 3 beeps to signify access denied, unrecognised person.
	
## TODO:
- Secure passwords with hashing
- Merge AWS Rekognition setup into front-end
- Save RFID card uid to DB
	- RFID card registration front-end
